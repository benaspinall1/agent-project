## Project Folder Structure Overview (In Sol not GitHub)

This repository is organized so that **model servers**, **Slurm job scripts**, and **experiment drivers** are clearly separated. Understanding this layout makes it easier to debug failures and onboard new contributors.

```
~/agent-project/
├── assistant-server.sh        # Launches the assistant vLLM server (OpenAI-compatible)
├── user-server.sh             # Launches the user vLLM server (OpenAI-compatible)
├── user-vllm-job.sh           # Slurm job wrapper for starting the user vLLM server
├── tau-experiment.sh          # Main Slurm job script that runs Tau-Bench
│
├── logs/                      # Slurm stdout logs for servers and experiments
├── errors/                    # Slurm stderr logs for servers and experiments
├── results/                   # Home for the json files
└── tau-bench/                 # Tau-Bench codebase

```

### Key Ideas

- **Server scripts** (`assistant-server.sh`, `user-server.sh`) are responsible only for starting vLLM instances.
- **Slurm job scripts** (`user-vllm-job.sh`, `tau-experiment.sh`) handle resource allocation and scheduling.
- **Tau-Bench itself** lives in its own subdirectory and is treated as an executable dependency.
- **Logs** are the first place to look when something fails.

This separation keeps experiments reproducible and prevents model server issues from contaminating benchmark logic.

## 1. Load Environment & Activate Conda/Mamba Env

Load the cluster-provided mamba module and activate the environment that contains PyTorch + vLLM support:

```bash
module load mamba/latest
source activate gaudi-pytorch-vllm
```

> ⚠️ All subsequent commands assume this environment is active.

---

## 2. Python Dependency Fixes

Some Tau-Bench and LiteLLM dependencies need to be explicitly installed at the user level:

```bash
pip install --user "litellm==1.41.0"
pip install --user "typing_extensions>=4.10.0"
pip install --user "tokenizers>=0.21,<0.22"
```
> ⚠️ You only need to run this once.

---

## 3. Start the User vLLM Server

Submit the Slurm job that launches the **user model** vLLM server:

```bash
sbatch user-vllm-job.sh
```

After submission, go into the **logs** directory and
scroll to the top of the file with this filename structure: "user_vllm_jobid.out". You should see the following output:

```
====================================
Starting USER vLLM server on node: gaudi001
User model: Qwen/Qwen3-32B
User server base: http://gaudi001:8007/v1
====================================
...
```

Verify that the user model is live at the gaudi endpoint:

```bash
curl -s http://gaudi001:8007/v1/models | jq
```

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: If you copy and paste this command make sure the port number matches the **User server base** from the **user_vllm_jobid.out** file

You should see a JSON response listing the specs of the user model.

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1770442353,
      "owned_by": "vllm",
      "root": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B",
      "parent": null,
      "max_model_len": 40960,
      "permission": [
        {
          "id": "modelperm-845d9dc64768b3a7",
          "object": "model_permission",
          "created": 1770442353,
          "allow_create_engine": false,
          "allow_sampling": true,
          "allow_logprobs": true,
          "allow_search_indices": false,
          "allow_view": true,
          "allow_fine_tuning": false,
          "organization": "*",
          "group": null,
          "is_blocking": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Export User Model API Base

Set the environment variable that Tau-Bench uses to locate the **user model** endpoint:

```bash
export USER_MODEL_API_BASE="http://gaudi001:8007/v1"
```
> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Again, if you copy and paste this command make sure the port number matches the **User server base** from the **user_vllm_jobid.out** file

---

## 5. Launch Tau-Bench Experiments

### Option A: Slurm Job Array (Recommended for Sweeps)

Run using a job array (This command does not assume that you start at 0 and end at 119. Choose any sub array below):

```bash
sbatch --array=0-119 tau-experiment.sh
```

```bash

# Copy any line below to run that experiment
# Each command ends with its task id for job array submissions

**Arguments (in order):**

1. Environment (e.g., `retail`)
2. Agent strategy (e.g., `react`)
3. Assistant model ID
4. `num_trials`

### Resuming after job timeout

The function below checks for an existing json file for the submitted job and gets starts the experiment for the next task in line.

**Example directory structure:** home/'asurite'/agent-project/results/retail/react/4B/num_trials-1.json

```bash
# Usage: set START_INDEX for resume; call before the python run.
set_start_index_from_checkpoint() {
  local ckpt="${RUN_DIR}/num_trials-${NUM_TRIALS_VAL}.json"
  START_INDEX=0
  if [[ -f "$ckpt" ]]; then
    local max_id
    max_id=$(jq -r '[.[].task_id] | max // empty' "$ckpt" 2>/dev/null)
    if [[ -n "$max_id" && "$max_id" != "null" ]]; then
      START_INDEX=$((max_id + 1))
      echo "Resuming: last task_id=$max_id, --start-index=$START_INDEX"
    fi
  fi
}

set_start_index_from_checkpoint
python run.py \
  ...
  --start-index "$START_INDEX" \
  --end-index -1 \ # Last task
  ...
```

### Other files edited to make this work: tau-bench/tau-bench/run.py

```python
def run(config: RunConfig) -> List[EnvRunResult]:

    ...
    ckpt_path = (
        f"{config.log_dir}/num_trials-{config.num_trials}.json"
    )
    ...
```

---

### Summary Flow

**High-level order of operations:**

1. Set permissions on scripts
2. Load mamba + activate environment
3. Install Python dependencies
4. Launch user vLLM server
5. Verify API endpoint
6. Export `USER_MODEL_API_BASE`
7. Submit Tau-Bench jobs

---

If anything fails, the most common issues are:

- Environment not activated
- vLLM server not fully started before Tau-Bench runs
- Missing or mismatched dependency versions
- Incorrect hostname or port in `USER_MODEL_API_BASE`

This document should be kept in sync with any future changes to scripts or dependency versions.
